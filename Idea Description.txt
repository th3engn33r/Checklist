this will be very simple, plain web application that I believe will have millions of users.

My targets for version 1 are:

1. Make a landing page that reads
	  CHECKLIST *green tick*
	are you sure ? or be sure!

- will have a textbox or dropbox to select activity like travelling, roadtripping etc
- depending on the activity, few more dropbox will emerge like destination and starting point.
- and then a button that reads "Check out!!!"

- Need to setup login/ signup so that people can make personalized list & print them

2. Intermediate page will have other options to choose from like select a more appropriate list based on description (amongst many options available)

3. this will show list items in clickable buttons. 
- Each button will have a small glyphicon on its right for not recommended.
- Clicking button means user recommed item on list
- a user can add more list items using the form at the end. (will be reviewed by us).

4. a registered user can make or personalize lists

5. Bussiness Model:
	- advertisement
	- links to ebay, amazon or local stores (they will be charged)
	- a registered user will have lesser advirtesement and pay $1 a year.
